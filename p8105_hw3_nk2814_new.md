### Problem 1

Load the Instacart data and necessary packages you might need.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.2.1     v purrr   0.3.2
    ## v tibble  2.1.3     v dplyr   0.8.3
    ## v tidyr   1.0.0     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   1.3.1     v forcats 0.4.0

    ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
library(dplyr)
data("instacart") 
```

**Write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and
structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving
illustrative examples of observations.**

There are 1,384,617 observations in this instacart dataset and 15
variables - this dataset captures information about online grocery
orders placed by Instacart users. Each row in this dataset is a product
from a specific order. Examples of variables include order\_number,
product\_name, as well as variables that capture when the order was
placed, such as order\_dow and order\_hour\_of\_day. For example, a row
in this dataset could be an order of Bulgarian Yogurt that was placed at
10 pm on a Saturday, along with more details about that order (the
grocery aisle the product came from, whether it was re-ordered, etc.)

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?**

There are 134 distinct aisles. The aisles from which the most items are
ordered are ‘fresh vegetables’, ‘fresh fruits’, and ‘packaged vegetables
fruits’.
